The tail command fails but carries on running.
The already running checker correctly determines that this is the command

gordon-netbook-3                    Environment monitor  log            	sessionId:51     17-Apr-2011 21:08:59 tail -F /var/app/environment-monitor/environment-monitor/log/environment-monitor-0.log

So it shouldn't try to start another. But I saw loads of these with status logged on ,  open,  ?
