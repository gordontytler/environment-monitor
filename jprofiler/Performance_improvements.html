<h2>Performance improvements using jconsole</h2>
<h3>Before</h3>
<p>
Environment monitor server was initially using 185% of CPU just to tail 5 remote log files.
<p>
(on a 2009 Acer netbook with dual core Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270   @ 1.60GHz - 1GB memory)
<p>
It was using ProcessBuilder to create a local process running ssh and reading the output stream from this.
ProcessBuilder was also used to execute bash to run python scripts to check which applications are running.
<p>
jprofiler produced this picture: <a href="jprofiler-initial-Screenshot.png">jprofiler-initial-Screenshot.png</a>
<p>
The problem areas were:
<ul>
<li>71.6% InputFromShellReader.readInputFromShell -  this was mainly caused by FileInputStream.available and String.decode
<li>24.6% UNIXProcess.waitForProcessExit - this is a bug in the process reaper thread which is fixed in the Open JDK but not in the Sun 1.6.0_18 version.
</ul>

<h3>Changes made</h3>
<p>
The ssh client process was replaced with the pure Java implementation <a href="http://www.cleondris.ch/opensource/ssh2/">Ganymed SSH-2 for Java</a>.
<p>
This proved to be so fast it was also used to run local bash processes. Ganymed made it possible to use a pseudo-terminal.
Looking for the terminal prompt speeded up the text processing needed to determine when a command has finished.
Previously this was taking 21.1%.

<p>
These improvements either caused or made it possible to fix some previously undetected thread blocking problems:
<p>
<a href="Current_locking_graph.html">locked by ChunkedOutput after client request to killRunningCommand</a><br>
<a href="Current_locking_graph_5.html">threads blocked by a lock owned by their own thread in java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler</a>
<hr size="1"/><br />
<h3>After</h3>
<p>
Environment monitor server was using just 4% of CPU to tail (and analyse) 5 remote log files.
<p>
<a href="Call_Tree.html">jprofiler call tree</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>40.7% - 19,406 ms sun.net.httpserver.ServerImpl$Exchange.run -  web server
<li>17.1% - 8,164 ms javax.xml.ws.Endpoint.publish -  web server
<li>13.4% - 6,392 ms monitor.implementation.shell.InputFromSSHReader.filter
</ul>
57% of cpu is now being used to publish the web view. Most of the 13.4% for InputFromSSHReader caused by FINE logging,
<p>
11.4% - 5,429 ms java.util.logging.Logger.info
<p>
which can be turned off.
